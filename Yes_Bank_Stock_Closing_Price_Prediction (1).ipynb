        "1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent cleaning procedures to address missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Standardization and normalization techniques were applied to ensure data consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): During this phase, the data was visualized and analyzed to extract insights. Cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, were performed. Data visualization techniques were employed to identify patterns and trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Feature Engineering: New features like Year, Month, and Quarter were engineered to capture temporal patterns and enhance model accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to facilitate model implementation. The training set was used to train the models, while the testing set was utilized for evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Model Implementation: Regression models, including Linear Regression (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Random Forest, were implemented to predict stock prices. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared. Cross-validation techniques were utilized to assess model performance on unseen data. The best-performing model was selected for production deployment based on comprehensive evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Model Explainability: Models were analyzed to interpret the factors influencing stock price predictions. Techniques like Permutation Importance Scores were used to assess feature importance and elucidate the relationship between features and predicted values.\n",

        "In summary, this project successfully utilized Linear Regression (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Random Forest for stock price prediction, encompassing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model implementation, and explainability analysis. The best-performing model as Linear regression(OLS) was selected based on comprehensive evaluation, achieving the project's objectives."

Against this backdrop, it is compelling to examine the impact of this incident on the bank's stock prices and assess the effectiveness of time series or other predictive models in capturing such intricate scenarios. The dataset under consideration spans monthly stock prices of Yes Bank from its inception, providing information on monthly closing, opening, highest, and lowest stock prices."

Candlestick charts are commonly used in financial analysis to visualize the movement of stock prices over time. Each candlestick represents the open, high, low, and close prices for a specific period (e.g., day, week, month), providing valuable insights into price trends, volatility, and market sentiment.\n",

        "Relevance to Financial Data: Candlestick charts are specifically designed to represent financial data, making them suitable for analyzing stock prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comprehensive Representation:** Each candlestick encapsulates four essential price points (open, high, low, close), offering a comprehensive view of price movements within a given period.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Easy Interpretation:** Candlestick patterns are intuitive to interpret, allowing analysts to quickly identify trends, reversals, and potential trading opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Visual Appeal:** Candlestick charts are visually appealing and can effectively communicate complex price dynamics to stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that the goal is to describe price movements in the dataset, the Candlestick chart is a suitable choice due to its ability to provide a detailed and insightful representation of stock price data"

        "The insights gained from the right-skewed distribution of the stock's closing prices can potentially create a positive business impact by informing investment strategies to capitalize on occasional significant increases and manage risks effectively. However, failure to adequately manage risks, such as volatility and overreliance on short-term gains, could lead to negative growth. Overemphasis on speculative trading based solely on occasional spikes in closing prices without considering fundamental factors may result in unsustainable growth and potential losses in the long term. Therefore, while the insights offer opportunities, careful risk management and consideration of long-term fundamentals are crucial to sustain positive growth."
